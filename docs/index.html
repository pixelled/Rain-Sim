    <h3 align="center">Technical Approach and Results</h3>
    <h4 align="center">Rain Appearance</h4>
    <p>We render raindrops with a raindrop-shaped texture but without a raindrop-shaped mesh. At first, we tried to render raindrops based on <a href="index.html#ref">Real-time Rain Simulation</a>, which draw raindrops as point sprites in the screen space. While the appearance of raindrops looks good from a horizontal perspective, it keeps its elliptical shape and doesn't change the orientation of textures when viewing from a vertical perspective.</p>
    <p>To achieve more realistic effects, we first bind each raindrop a \(1 \times 1\) quad lying on xy plane, with texture coordinates binded with its four vertices. However, the raindrop texture would not be visible with a single quad if viewing from the cross section of the quad. To ensure the raindrop keeps its appearance correct when viewing different perspectives, We convert the quad coordinates into a space with its x axis aligned with view space's x axis and its y axis aligned with the direction of the raindrop's velocity in view space. This ensures the texture always faces the camera in view space. Finally, we perform transformations into view space and projection space as usual. In addition, the opacity of each raindrop changes based on their distance from the camera to make the rainy scene more realistic. Below is a video showing how raindrops change their shapes in different perspectives.</p>

    <h4 align="center">Raindrop Splashes</h4>
    <p>We render splashes as an animation with each frame sampled from the textures below. The texture incorporates a single filmed high-quality milk drop splash sequence (referenced from <a href="index.html#ref">Artist-Directable Real-Time Rain Rendering in City Environments</a>). Everytime a raindrop collides with the ground, a splash is generated at the collision point with its size randomized to mitigate visual repetition of the same splash textures. We also change the opacity of splashes based on the wetness degree of the ground to trick viewers that no splashes seem to be on the dry ground. </p>
    <p>Each splash is rendered as a point splash in the screen space. To do this in OPENGL, we bind a \(1 \times 1\) quad to the splash and translate it to the colliding position in view space. The texture coordinates is rotated based on the normal of the collision point and scaled based on the splash size. Finally, apply projection transformation as usual. Below is a video that shows a closer look at splashes.</p>
